# Convolution-from-Scratch
At the heart of any convolutional neural network lies convolution, an operation highly specialized at detecting patterns in images.

Convolutional layers require you to specify the number of filters (kernels). Think of these as a number of pattern detectors. Early convolutional layers detect basic patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on. Depending on the dataset, specialized patterns are detected at later convolutional layers.

Take a look at a convolution operation in action in the notebook.
